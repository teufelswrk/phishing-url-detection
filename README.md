# Phishing URL Detection

## Introduction

The Phishing Detection Script is a basic tool designed to check if a given URL might be a phishing link. Please note that this script uses regular expressions and does not provide comprehensive phishing protection.

This script checks if the provided URL matches common URL patterns. This is a very basic approach and might not catch sophisticated phishing attempts. For comprehensive and robust phishing detection, you would need more advanced techniques like machine learning, reputation databases, and real-time analysis.

When you run this script, it will prompt the user to enter a URL. The script will then check if the provided URL might be a phishing link or not. Keep in mind that this is still a basic approach and may not catch all phishing attempts. For robust phishing detection, more advanced techniques additional resources would be necessary.
